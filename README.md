# CoffeeLab - Site Rebrand Project

A complete UI/UX transformation for a Brazilian specialty coffee shop, reimagining a basic website into an immersive digital experience.

This project focuses on creating a sensory-driven digital experience that mirrors the rich, nuanced experience of specialty coffee consumption. Moving beyond mere aesthetics, the design employs visual depth, thoughtful animations, and an expanded color palette to engage users on a more emotional level. Each element was carefully crafted to communicate the artisanal quality and attention to detail that defines the CoffeeLab brand, transforming a functional website into an immersive digital environment that stimulates the senses.
